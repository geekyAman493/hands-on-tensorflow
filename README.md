# 🧠 TensorFlow Learning Journey

Welcome to my TensorFlow practice repository!  
This repo contains all my notebooks as I explore deep learning concepts and TensorFlow implementations — from basic models to advanced architectures.

## 📚 Contents
- **Linear Regression with TensorFlow**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** (coming soon)
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** (coming soon)
- **Transfer Learning** (coming soon)
- **Image Classification with TensorFlow** (coming soon)
- **Custom Training Loops & Callbacks** (coming soon)

## 🚀 Goals
- Strengthen my deep learning fundamentals
- Experiment with real-world datasets
- Build end-to-end ML pipelines using TensorFlow

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit learn
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

## 🤝 Contributions
This repo grows as I learn — feedback, suggestions, and collaborations are welcome!
